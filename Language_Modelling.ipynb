    "#### Please answer the following questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What can we say about the generated text in terms of grammar and coherence? \n",
    "\n",
    "The text generated by a Bigram model is generally poor in grammar and lacking in long-term coherence. Because a Bigram model only predicts the next token based on the single preceding token, it has no \"memory\" of the overall sentence structure or the subject of a story.\n",
    "- While it may occasionally form valid two-word pairs (e.g., \"once upon\"), it cannot maintain a consistent narrative or follow complex grammatical rules like subject-verb agreement over a full sentence.\n",
    "- The output often appears as a \"word salad\" where each individual transition is statistically likely, but the collective sequence is nonsensical.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the limitations of the Bigram language model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary limitation is its extremely limited context window.\n",
    "- Lack of Long-Range Dependencies: Since it only looks at the immediate previous word ($n-1$), it cannot understand relationships between words that are farther apart.\n",
    "- Context Blindness: It cannot maintain the \"state\" of a story. For example, if a story starts with \"Once upon a time there was a king,\" a Bigram model will likely forget the \"king\" by the time it generates the next five words.\n",
    "- Fixed Context Length: In your BigramConfig, the context_length is explicitly set to 1, which prevents the model from ever seeing more than one token at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the model is scaled with more parameters do you expect the bigram model to get substantially better? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, scaling parameters will not make a Bigram model substantially better. * Structural Bottleneck: The limitation is architectural, not a lack of capacity. Adding more layers or neurons to the MLP (the self.linear layer) might help the model learn the statistical distribution of word pairs more accurately, but it still won't be able to \"see\" more than one word into the past.\n",
    "- Information Deficiency: To improve coherence and grammar, a model needs a larger context_length. This is why the project moves toward Mini GPT, which uses Self-Attention to look at many previous tokens simultaneously rather than just the last one. Without increasing the context window, more parameters simply lead to a more \"perfect\" memory of a fundamentally limited local transition."

The output of the transformer layer is passed through a linear layer (called head) to get the final output logits.

This allows us to save on parameters and also helps in training."
